Difference between public and private cloud:
============================================
Public cloud-- cloud service available via internet
AWS,AZURE,Google cloud, Alibaba
Private cloud -- cloud service available via intranet
HP helium,Xen,Hyper V, Openstack
Hybrid cloud-- expanding the private cloud infra to public cloud( eg. we can extend opennebula infra to aws)

POC=proof of concept

the word cloud computing was invented by ramnath chellappa
CAPEX == capital expenditure(fully owned by us)
OPEX  == Operational expenditure(services alone owned)

Regions:
========
N.Virginia is where the new services are take place & also it not recommended to take production over there since it is not stable amongst.

Region is a physical location which consists two or more availability zones.
Region-availability zones
Simple a region consists for two availability zones, availability zones means datacenter.

Edgelocations: Edgelocations are endpoints  for AWS which used for caching content. which is basically cloud front, the Content delivery network for AWS.
edgelocation--cachingcontent--cloudfront

Identity access Management:(IAM)
================================
IAM allows you to manage the users & their level of access to AWS console.
Centralized control of AWS accnt; shared access to your account; Granular permission(permitting only specific services & their level of access), multifactor authentication(login,pwd & special character box), Identity federation(includes AD,FB etc)
IAM policies should have 4 elements, its JSON format.
1.Principal - Dont provide everyone for access
2.Action    - Type of access
3.Resource   -object
4.condition  -restriction

S3:(Simple storage Service)
==
It provides highly scalable object storage.

S3 is object based i.e it allows you to upload files
Files size will be 0bytes to 5TB
Files are stored in buckets(bucket is basically a folder)
It must be unique, becoz it will have one ipaddress globally.(Universal Namespace)
When you upload the files, it will be HTTP200 status once it uploaded successfully
Simple storage service(S3) consists of,
*Key(name of the object)
*value(data made up of sequence of bytes)
*Version ID(version controlling for data)
*Metadata(data about data)
*Access control lists & torrents 

How S3 is consistent:
=====================
Read after write consistency for PUTS of New Objects
Eventual consistencty for overwrite PUTS & Deletes (can take some time to propagate)

Means,
If you write the newfile & read it immediately afterwards, you will able to view that data.
If you update an existing file or delete a file and read it immediately , you may get older version or may not. but it takes a little bit of time
to propagate.

S3 features:
==============
*Tiered storage
*Life cycle management(optional to  move the files if it gets 30days old& etc)
*Versioning
*encryption
*MFA for delete(Multi factor authentication)
*secure data using ACL & bucket policies.

Storage classes:
================
*S3 standard (99.99% availabilty & durability) & redundant storage across multiple devices in multiple facilities.
*S3-Infrequent access:(for data accessed less frequently, but requires fast access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but charges on data retrieval.
*S3-one zone IA:same has previous, but it located in one zone only, not redundant(It is also called RRS(reduce redundant storage))
*S3 Intelligent Tiering: Designed to optimize cost by automatically moving data to most cost effective access tier.
*S3 Glacier:storing archived data. Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.
*S3 Glacier deep archival: S3 glacier is S3's lowest cost storage class where retrieval time of 12hrs is acceptable.(but we can get data after 12hrs only)

Amazon S3 transfer acceleration, it takes advantage of cloudfront(edge locations to bucket)

S3 is not suitable for installing OS & databases

Create an S3 Bucket:
====================
For viewing buckets, the locations will be changed to global.

Cloud computing offers 
IAAS,SAAS,PAAS

Infrastructure as a service offers
Virtual servers, virtual storage , virtual networks & also bare metal servers(which is a dedicated hardware server)
